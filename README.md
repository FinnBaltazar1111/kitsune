# Kitsune
Clone of [**kitsuneoffline**](https://github.com/LiEnby/kitsuneoffline) modified to run in the web with it's default features like save state management, with some new features like a cheat engine.

## Planned updates
* Somehow add support for installing new versions (probably not gonna happen)
* Preload & cache resources so game can be played online if it is loaded beforehand
